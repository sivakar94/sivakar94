### Hi there. I'm Siva 👋

- A recent master's graduate with a major in Artificial Intelligence with a background in Python, Machine learning, and Deep Learning. I am passionate about Data science and building scalable models. Self-motivated, eager to learn, can work in a fast-paced environment, and effectively communicate with other people.

- 🔭 I recently worked on data engineering projects using Spark, Airflow, and AWS Redshift infrastructure that can be leveraged to common use cases in data science such as moving data efficiently into the cloud, performing ETL operations, quality checks, and making data readily available for data scientists and Business Analysts. 

- 🌱 The most interesting thing about me is if I am given a project, I put my full initiative into it. Even if I don't know the answer to a question/problem, I work really hard to find the solution to the problem.
